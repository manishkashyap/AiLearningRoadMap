Service Partner Integration
RCS Service Provider
Welcome to WebEngage's Developer Hub!
RSPs can integrate their platform with the WebEngage Marketing Automation Suite using this documentation.
How to Initiate RSP Integration?
We'd love to add you to our Service Partner Network! Please feel free to initiate a conversation by dropping an email at
[email protected]
with the following details:
Service provider's test credentials (e.g. Username and Password or Api Key, and API endpoint where WebEngage will post messages).
A logo of the service provider with minimum width of 370 px and preferably in Adobe Illustrator file format.
A static endpoint which listens to incoming
HTTPS
POST
requests and adheres to the specified schema for sending RCS message. Note that this needs to be a single static endpoint. If you have multiple such endpoints based on e.g. geography, you will have to accept WebEngage requests on a single endpoint and then route them accordingly.
The request authentication method (Basic authentication or Bearer authentication).
Input fields to be shown to the client on WebEngage dashboard. For example: API Key or Username and Password.
In case of API Key, the
POST
request will contain the header
Authorization: Bearer API_KEY.
In case of Username and Password, the
POST
request will contain the header
Authorization: Basic BASE_64(USERNAME:PASSWORD)
.
For example, if your username is 'webengage' and password is 'admin' then the Authorization header will be
Basic d2ViZW5nYWdlOmFkbWlu
. The string d2ViZW5nYWdlOmFkbWlu is the Base64 encoded version of the string
webengage:admin
.
WebEngage Support will process the request if there is a mutual client willing to try out the integration and add the service provider in private beta mode on WebEngage dashboard.
Section 1: The flow of the message will be as follows:
WebEngage will send message to the RCS Service Provider (RSP) and RSP will reply synchronously to the message received with respective Status Codes given in the last section of this documentation.
RSP will reply back to WebEngage webhook (i.e. static endpoint which can be found on WebEngage dashboard following: **Integrations > Channels > RCS > ACTIONS (RSP) > View Webhook URL.**for delivery report (i.e. Delivery Status Notification (DSN)) asynchronously.
1. WebEngage RCS Request to RSP
As depicted in SECTION 1 point 1, WebEngage will send RCS message to RSP in the following given payload format and RSP needs to reply synchronously to the message with Status Codes provided in the last section of this documentation.
Key points for API request from WebEngage to RSP:
At the time of integration, WebEngage allows RSP to accept
parameters
in the payload request from WebEngage to RSP.
parameters
is a Map of key value pairs of the template variables provided by user as per template. e.g. if the template is:
hello {{key1}}, welcome to new {{key2}}
and template variables i.e.
{{key1}}
and
{{key2}}
are
john
and
world
, then the
parameters
will be:
{"key1":"john", "key2":"world"}
.
templateData
provided in given below payload will only contain
parameters
as per RSP’s choice at the time of integration.
The
Content-Type
header will always be
application/json
. We’ll also provide support for adding custom headers (specific to individual RSP) while user creates RCS RSP configuration on WebEngage dashboard.

Key
Description
version
Indicates the payload contract. If there is any change in the payload structure in future, the version will be updated.
toNumber
The recipient’s phone number along with country code as prefix.
sender
The RCS SenderID you are using to send the campaign.
templateName
Name of template used
parameters
Template variables with the exact name and sequence as added in dashboard.
timestamp
The time when the message was triggered from the WebEngage system. This follows the ISO date format:
yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss±hhmm
.
messageId
Unique ID assigned to the message which should be used in further Delivery Status Notifications to identify a message uniquely.
campaignType
PROMOTIONAL
customData
In this section , you can pass extra data (in Key-value pair format from the dashboard) in the payload. This is mainly used by partners if they require some custom integrations to be done for their internal systems or for particular clients.
To use 'Open a URL' button click tracking clients have to use steps mentioned
here
Example curl request with
parameters
and API Key for authentication:
cURL
curl --location --request POST '<RSP-API-END-POINT>' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <API-KEY>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
 "version": "1.0",
 "rcsData": {
 "toNumber": "+919999999999",
 "sender": "<senderId>",
 "templateData": {
 "templateName": "templateName",
 "parameters": {
 "paramkey1": "paramValue1",
 "paramkey2": "paramValue2"
 }
 },
 "customData": {
 "customkey1": "customValue1",
 "customkey2": "customValue2"
 }
 },
 "metadata": {
 "campaignType": "PROMOTIONAL",
 "timeStamp": "2024-12-20T12:00:21+0000",
 "messageId": "<messageId>"
 }
}'
Examples for synchronous response for above payloads from RSP to WebEngage:
Example 1: Message Accepted Successfully
JSON
HTTP 200 OK
{
 "status" : "rcs_accepted",
 "statusCode": 0
}
Example 2: Message Cannot be Sent further
NOTE: If the status code is not
0
, send
message
property too.
JSON
HTTP 200 OK
{
 "status": "rcs_rejected",
 "statusCode": 2000,
 "message": "Not enough credit to send message"
}
Example 3: Payload Not Acceptable
NOTE: In case there is mismatch in payload version of API contract (current is 1.0).
JSON
HTTP 400 BAD REQUEST
{
 "status" : "rcs_rejected",
 "statusCode" : 2010,
 "message" : "Version not supported",
 "supportedVersion" : "1.0" // Mandatory in case of statusCode 2010
}
2. Delivery Status Notification (DSN) from RSP to WebEngage
Delivery report of each message forwarded by RSP to WebEngage is called as Delivery Status Notification (DSN). It helps our clients to track their campaign's performance in their WebEngage dashboard.
As depicted in SECTION 1 point 2, DSNs are asynchronous updates to messages (e.g. RCS message delivered, expired, rejected etc.) that RSP sends to WebEngage webhook. This is shown in the flowchart below.
Key points for DSN from RSP to WebEngage:
RSP is required to
POST
DSN i.e. RCS message sent, failed, etc. on the static endpoint which can be found on WebEngage dashboard following:
Data Platform > Integrations > WhatsApp Setup (Configure) > ACTIONS (WSP) > View Webhook URL
.
WebEngage comes with three servers: Saudi Arabia, India and US servers, and it is necessary that the DSN is configured for all servers.
You can find the DSN tracking link below. The DSN Token will be provided once the integration and testing are done by the WebEngage team.
The service provider is required to POST Delivery Status Notifications (DSNs) i.e. RCS Message sent, failed, etc. on the static endpoint.
For US Server :
https://rt.webengage.com/tracking/events
For IN Server :
https://rt.in.webengage.com/tracking/events
For KSA Server :
https://rt.ksa.webengage.com/tracking/events
RSP will be provided with:
Auth token
- which needs to be included as an Authorization header in the
POST
request of DSNs.
e.g.
Authorization: Bearer <Auth token>
. This token will remain the same and should not be shared to ensure security. In case there is a need to change the token, RSP should reach out to WebEngage Support to get a new token.
Content-Type
Header for the DSN request should be
application/json
.
WebEngage will respond to the DSN request with an
HTTP 2XX
response code.

yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss±hhmm.
Example curl request of DSN with[
Auth token

JSON
curl --location --request POST '<STATIC-DSN-END-POINT-OF-WEBENGAGE>' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <AUTH-TOKEN-PROVIDED-BY-WEBENGAGE>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
